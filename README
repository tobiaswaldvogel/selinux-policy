Introduction:

    This repository contains a basic modern SELinux security policy
    designed specifically for OpenWrt. It uses the Type-Enforcement
    security model to implement a targeted policy model that covers a
    moderate selection of basic components with the goal of enhancing
    integrity to help ensure continuity of systems operations.
    Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a flexible framework that
    allows for fine-grained mandatory access control.

    The SELinux policy is written in modern Common Intermediate
    Language that is native to SELinux and can easily be extended to
    address a wide variety of access control challenges. The
    permissive license allows for creation of custom policy models
    based off of this basic SELinux policy to be enclosed -for
    example using the Image Builder that supports SELinux- as a
    replacement.

Installation:

    Please see support/selinux-policy-XXXX for an example package
    manifest for OpenWrt.
