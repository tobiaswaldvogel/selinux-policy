figure out why /etc/group /etc/passwd /etc/shadow might end up mislabeled on sysupgrade that introduces a new user or group
i think this function is used: https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/openwrt.git;a=blob_plain;f=package/base-files/files/lib/preinit/80_mount_root;h=a15c972220c566b381b35e6095e7a9ee055fe8ae;hb=HEAD
i guess one way to figure this out might be to add an auditallow rule for file.conffile creation

domains that call both loadkernelmodule and modulerequest might only need modulerequest (it seems that if modulerequest fails it falls back to loadkernelmodule)
the "readwrite.subj_type" macros arent always called in the right container (review them all)
mmc, sr, and fd (floppy) are really removable.stordev (move them back to removablestordev.cil)
