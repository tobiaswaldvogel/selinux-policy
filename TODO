13:38 < bauen1> but there is a lot of low-hanging fruit, like dontauditing 0x5401 (TCGETS) and TCGETA, and
moving ioctl to the "write" set for files, at least once linux 5.11 hits with my dontauditx
patch to make it work

(call .tmp.associate_filesystems (.file.obj_typeattr)))) in volatileoverlayselinuxbool.cil is too broad
since file.obj_typeattr applies to all non fs files (do a grep -r xattr.associate to see which types need to associate with tmp.fs in a volatile root scenario)

Were this:
sed -i "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
creates /etc/groupRANDOM and renames it to /etc/group afterwards
if i understand correctly then:
sed -i'' "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
fixes it

domains that call both loadkernelmodule and modulerequest might only need modulerequest (it seems that if modulerequest fails it falls back to loadkernelmodule)

the "readwrite.subj_type" macros arent always called in the right container (review them all)

mmc, sr, and fd (floppy) are really removable.stordev (move them back to removablestordev.cil)
