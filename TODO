Were this:
sed -i "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
creates /etc/groupRANDOM and renames it to /etc/group afterwards
if i understand correctly then:
sed -i'' "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
fixes it

domains that call both loadkernelmodule and modulerequest might only need modulerequest (it seems that if modulerequest fails it falls back to loadkernelmodule)

the "readwrite.subj_type" macros arent always called in the right container (review them all)

mmc, sr, and fd (floppy) are really removable.stordev (move them back to removablestordev.cil)
