deal with kmod, sysctl(-procps-ng)

Various misc:
-------------

I added a coreutilexecfile.cil module for coreutils and a call in shell.execute_execfile_files():
but it is probably sub-optimal as its very expensive
Might eventually be better to just not use coreutilexecfile.cil and instead allow callers of shell.execute_execfile_files()
to execute file.execfile as well (much cheaper and easier to maintain)

13:38 < bauen1> but there is a lot of low-hanging fruit, like dontauditing 0x5401 (TCGETS) and TCGETA, and
moving ioctl to the "write" set for files, at least once linux 5.11 hits with my dontauditx
patch to make it work

(call .tmp.associate_filesystems (.file.obj_typeattr)))) in volatileoverlayselinuxbool.cil is too broad
since file.obj_typeattr applies to all non fs files (do a grep -r xattr.associate to see which types need to associate with tmp.fs in a volatile root scenario)

Were this:
sed -i "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
creates /etc/groupRANDOM and renames it to /etc/group afterwards
if i understand correctly then:
sed -i'' "s/$grp/$grp$delim$2/g" ${IPKG_INSTROOT}/etc/group
fixes it
